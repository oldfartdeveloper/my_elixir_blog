This is my blog for his learning and implementing experiences with Elixir.

I have been programming for food since 1968 when I got my first paying gig writing APL.  Since then,
I've gone through almost all the "common" programming languages.  Some of them have felt like
"astounding discoveries" when I encountered them and caused me to make big career changes:

* C
* HyperCard
* Smalltalk
* Ruby
* Elixir

I wonder what Elixir will bring?
